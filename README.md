# Moodle API and webhooks

This project with 2 scenarios. For this example I have create an App on React Native [(repo is here)](https://github.com/CrisRonda/ReactNative-Moodle). 

# How does it work?
For this example I have considered 2 scenarios one for: 
- Firebase and FCM
- Custom server with NodeJS
## Scenario 1
Next image explain flow of login and notifications to app 
<div style='margin-bottom: 8px'>
<img align="center" src="screenshots/firebase.jpg"/>
</div>

## Scenario 2 
In this scenario you can do anything that you want in your nodeJS server.
For example the login I use nodejs server, while data of courses I can get of moodle directly and presenta on React Native Moodle App [(repo is here)](https://github.com/CrisRonda/ReactNative-Moodle) but
<div style='margin-bottom: 8px'>
<img align="center" src="screenshots/example.jpg"/>
</div>

**Note:** Scenario 2 is complicate and isn't functional but is just an example ðŸ˜‰
